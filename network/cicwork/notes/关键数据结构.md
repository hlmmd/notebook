# 第二章 关键数据结构

struct sk_buff

* This is where a packet is stored. The structure is used by all the network layers to store their headers, information about the user data (the payload), and other information needed internally for coordinating their work.

struct net_device

* Each network device is represented in the Linux kernel by this data structure, which contains information about both its hardware and its software configuration. See Chapter 8 for details on when and how net_device data structures are allocated.

## The Socket Buffer: sk_buff Structure

This is probably the most important data structure in the Linux networking code, representing the headers for data that has been received or is about to be transmitted

Its fields can be classified roughly into the following categories:

* Layout
* General
* Feature-specific
* Management functions

This structure is used by several different network layers (MAC or another link protocol on the L2 layer, IP on L3, TCP or UDP on L4), and various fields of the structure change as it is passed from one layer to another.

When the buffer passes up through the network layers, each header from the old layer is no longer of interest.

Instead of removing the L2 header from the buffer, the pointer to the beginning of the payload is moved ahead to the beginning of the L3 header

## 字段布局

A few of the sk_buff's fields exist just to facilitate searching and to organize the data structure itself. The kernel maintains all sk_buff structures in a doubly linked list. But the organization of this list is somewhat more complicated than that of a traditional doubly linked list.

```c
struct sk_buff_head {
/* These two members must be first. */
    struct sk_buff * next;
    struct sk_buff * prev;
    _ _u32 qlen;
    spinlock_t lock;
};
```
next、prev指针，qlen为表长度，lock为锁(自旋锁)？

### list

每个sk_buff指向sk_buff_head结构的指针。

### struct sock *sk

指向对应的套接字sock数据结构。如果不是接收或者发送端，而仅仅是转发这个包，那么此指针为NULL

### unsigned int len


...

## net_device

The fields of the net_device structure can be classified into the following categories:

* Configuration
* Statistics
* Device status
* List management
* Traffic management
* Feature specific
* Generic
* Function pointers (or VFT)
